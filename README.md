# Advanced C++ Examples Repository

This repository is a collection of various C++ examples and methods demonstrated in our Advanced C++ class. It is organized by lectures and covers key programming concepts in C++ such as sorting, searching, recursion, and mathematical operations.

## Repository Structure

The directory structure is organized by lectures, with each folder containing methods or concepts covered in the respective lecture. Here's the breakdown:

```
advanced-cpp/
├── concepts/
│   ├── swap-pointer-reference.png  # Visual explanation of pointers vs. references
├── lecture-1/
│   ├── functional-student-methods-1  # Methods for working with student structs
├── lecture-2/
│   ├── binary-search-2              # Binary search implementation
│   ├── bubble-sort-2                # Bubble sort example
│   ├── max-min-2                    # Maximum and Minimum calculation
│   ├── swap-using-pointers-2        # Swap function using pointers
│   ├── swap-using-reference-2       # Swap function using references
├── lecture-3/
│   ├── fact-3                       # Factorial calculation
│   ├── fibonacci-3                  # Fibonacci sequence calculation
│   ├── gcd-3                        # Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) calculation
│   ├── power-3                      # Power calculation using recursion
```

## Purpose

This repository serves as a reference for:
- Understanding and implementing fundamental C++ concepts.
- Practicing algorithms such as sorting, searching, and recursion.
- Working with functions, pointers, and references in C++.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to **Ahmad**, who contributed valuable insights and helped gather information for this repository. His collaboration was crucial in organizing and documenting the examples effectively.

## How to Use

To explore and run the examples, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Run the following command in your terminal to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirAbaris/advanced-cpp.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the directory:
```bash
cd advanced-cpp
```

### 3. Explore Lecture Folders
Each folder contains individual programs or methods. Navigate to the desired lecture and compile the code using any C++ compiler, such as `g++`.

Example for compiling a file in lecture-2:
```bash
cd lecture-2/binary-search-2
g++ binary_search.cpp -o binary_search
./binary_search
```
